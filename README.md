# adb_bash

 - a magisk module that make "adb shell" colorful

# What it used for?

 - I believed that everyone used bash may thinking a question:

> _Why Android shell (`/system/bin/sh`) is mksh?_

 - maybe some system app developers are interested in mksh, but NOT ME!

 - so I need a bash...at least for adb shell.

# Install

download [releases](https://github.com/Sodium-Aluminate/adb_bash/releases) or just zip everything in repo.
And install by magisk manager.

# Uninstall

1. uninstall the module in magisk manager(or `rm -rf /data/adb/modules/adb_bash` in recovery in case you messed up something)

2. delete /data/adb_home dir... If you have OCD :)

3. ~~Contact the author and blame the module~~
